schindler&#39;s list (辛德勒的名单 影评)
　　Was Oskar a god?or a saint?I don't think so.He was only been a profiteer and womanizer at first but he was a man who still had some humanity.He just didn't want to see innocent people killed only because they were jewish.I think this is showed precisely in the movie,which accords with my feeling very well.　　　　Except for the colorful scenes at the end,there's only a girl in red which is not black n white in the film.I don't know what it exactly means,maybe just a emphasis(I can't imagine another way to tell us it's the same girl.By the way,it's said in real history the girl survived unlike in the film,but if there were more than one girl in red in the war(it's probably right),you can't say they're definitely the same one).　　　　S.Spielberg is a sensational storyteller and it's his masterpiece.It tells a long but seizing story that will never make you sleep.　　　　Oskar is undoubtedly a charming man well performed by L.Neeson even since the very beginning in the movie,with the most popular melody also used in Scent of Women and True Lies.R.Fiensse is also incredible in acting like a beast.Their not winning Oscar is such a pity.　　　　It's a good story but it's still not a ducumentary,so I can't say it's just the history,but it really shocks me.　　　　At the end,the actors and the persons they're acting come to the grave of Schindler's in pairs.I think this originality is very interesting.Finally there's someone putting a bouquet of flowers on the grave instead of a pebble.Maybe you've gotten it,it's L.Neeson.　　　　It says that whoever saves one life saves the world.
