纯粹的生命与不纯粹的生活 (闻香识女人 影评)
　　　　　这是一段经典的台词：Frank: I'll show you out of order. You don't know what out of order is, Mr. Trask, I'd show you, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too fuck in' blind, if I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a flame thrower to this place! Out of order? Who the hell do you think you're talkin' to? I've been around, you know? There was a time I could see, and I have seen, boys like these, younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off, but there is nothin' like the sight of an amputated spirit. There is no prosthetic for that, you think you're merely sendin' this splendid foot solider back home to Oregen with his tail between his legs, but I say you're executin' his soul! And why? Because he is not a Baird man. Baird men, you hurt this boy, you're gonna be Baird bums, the lot of you. And Harry, Jimmy, and Trent, wherever you are out there, fuck you too!　　　　斯莱德中校：让你见识见识什么是破坏规矩，你不知道什么叫破坏规矩，垂斯克先生，真该让你见识，可我太老了，太累了，我他妈的还是个瞎子。要是五年前，我会拿火焰喷射剂把这给烧了！破坏规矩？你以为在跟谁说话？我可是久经沙场，那时候我还能看得见，我看见的是象他们这么大，甚至还要小孩子们胳膊被炸断了，腿被截肢了，可但那些都不及丑陋的灵魂可怕，因为灵魂没有义肢。你以为你只是把这个好青年像落水狗一样的送回俄勒冈的老家？？你们泯灭的是他的灵魂！！为什么？！就因为他不够做一个拜尔德人？拜尔德人，你们若是伤害了这个孩子，你们就是拜尔德的混蛋，你们全是。哈瑞、吉米、特伦特，不管你们坐在哪，见你们的鬼！　　　　帕西诺将其酣畅的演绎出来，对于这不电影。经典的太多，细细体会的太多。实际上又是一种生命体验式的历练。
