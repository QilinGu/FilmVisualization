Braveheart (勇敢的心 影评)
　　伴着苏格兰风笛看这部苏格兰和英格兰的民族战争史。 　　Mel Gibson在本片中担当了导演、制作和演员三个角色，是他在《致命武器》后的一个突破。 　　大学时看的没字幕的，现在再看一次，才真正明白。　　　　William Wallace:Fight and you may die, run, and you'll live... at least for a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin' to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!
