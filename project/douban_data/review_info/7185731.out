真实的接触，善恶的挣扎 (撞车 影评)
　　故事是发生在洛杉矶--这个多民族、多文化聚集的大城市。影片的开始就是一起看似普通的撞车事件，以及几个与这个事件有关的人。然后，镜头将我们带到这次撞车事件发生的前一天，并分别向我们展示了这几个主要人物在这几十个小时中所发生的事情。　　那个洛杉矶警察局的警察(马特·狄龙饰)，希望能给自己患病的老父亲找到更好的医疗救助，但是，在HMO，任凭他如何的请求，负责处理这件事情的黑人职员就是不签署文件，以允许他父亲去找别的医生。随后，这名警察在处理交通堵塞的时候，将自己心中的怨气通通的爆发在一对黑人夫妻的身上。地区检察官(布兰登·费舍尔饰)与地位显赫的妻子简(桑德拉·布洛克饰)被两个年轻的黑人用枪指着头，只能无奈地看着他们抢走自己的越野吉普。回到家之后，心中的恐惧仍未消退的简，无缘无故地对上门为他们换锁的墨西哥裔修锁匠丹尼尔(迈克尔·佩纳饰)大发光火。可怜老实的丹尼尔在当天的晚上，又一次让一名阿拉伯裔的商店店主夺去了他的尊严。　　黑人侦探格雷厄姆焦急地在寻找着他走失的弟弟，但又不得不受上司的威胁，去面对黑洞洞的枪口……一个又一个的角色在观众吃惊的目光地注视下，由正义到邪恶、由被伤害者到施暴者不断的转换着。　　　　1、这就是接触的感觉。你知道吗？走在任何城市里，你都会和别人擦身而过，别人也会撞到你。但在洛杉矶，没有人会碰到你。我们总是像隔着层金属和玻璃。我想我们很怀念那种接触，我们只有互相撞击，才会感觉到什么。　　　　2、　　　　Dad：How's it goin'?　　　　Daughter: Okay. ..you didn’t get scared or something,did you?　　　　Dad: there’s no monsters in the colset.right? ‘cause I hate monsters.　　　　Daughter: there’s no such thing as monsters.　　　　Dad: Ah,that’s a good thing.　　　　Daughter: I heard a bang.　　　　Dad: like a truck bang?　　　　Daughter: like a gun.　　　　Dad: that’s funny, ‘cause we moved out that bad neighborhood.and there’s not too many guns around here.　　　　Daughter: how far can bullets go?　　　　Dad: they go pretty far. But they usually get stuck in something and stop.　　　　Daughter: what if they don’t?　　　　Dad: You thinking about that bullet that came through your window? You think we should move again?　　　　Daughter: I like it here.　　　　Dad: Me too. But if that bullet found out where we lived...Oh, hold on.　　　　Daughter: What?　　　　Dad: So stupid! How can I forget this?　　　　Daughter: what?　　　　Dad: Nah. Forget it. You aren't gonna believe me.　　Daughter: Tell me.　　Dad: Okay. When I was five, this fairy came into my room one night.　　　　Daughter: … Right.　　Dad: See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me. Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.　　Daughter: No, tell me.　　Dad: Okay. So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like, &quot;Yeah, right, you're a fairy. &quot; Anyway, we're talking, you know. And she's flying all around the room, knocking down all my posters and stuff. 　　Daughter: She was flying?　　Dad: She had these little stubby wings. She could've glued 'em on, you know? Like I'm gonna believe ,she's a fairy. So she said, &quot;I'll prove it. &quot; So she reaches into her backpack.. And she pulls out this invisible cloak. She ties it around my neck, and she tells me,that it's impenetrable.You know what impenetrable means?　　　　Daughter:…..　　　　Dad: It means that nothing can go through it. No bullets. Nothing. She told me that if I wore it,　　nothing would hurt me. So I did. And my whole life, I never got shot, stabbed. Nothing.I mean, how weird is that? Only she told me that I was supposed to give it to my daughter on her fifth birthday. And I forgot.　　Daughter: Can I touch it?　　Dad: Sure, go ahead.　　Daughter: I don't feel it.　　Dad: Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh? I can take it off and tie it around your houlders. She told me how to do it. Unless you think it's stupid.　　Daughter: Don't you need it?　　Dad: No, not anymore. So what do you think? You want it? Okay, let's get outta here.　　Daughter: Okay.　　Dad: Put your head up….Okay. Is that too tight? Do you feel anything at all? Good. Then it's just right.　　Daughter: Do I take it off when I have a bath?　　Dad:No, you leave it on all the time. Until you have a daughter when she turns five,　　then you give it to her. Okay?　　Daughter: Okay…Okay. Good night, sweetie.　　Dad: Good night.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　3、　　　　Graham: It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're  always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.　　　　格拉汉姆：这就是接触的感觉。你知道吗？走在任何城市里，你都会和别人擦身而过，别人也会撞到你。但在洛杉矶，没有人会碰到你。我们总是像隔着层金属和玻璃。我想我们很怀念那种接触，我们只有互相撞击，才会感觉到什么。　　　　Anthony: It's just black people demeaning other black people, using that word over and over. You ever hear white people callin' each other &quot;honky&quot; all the time? &quot;Hey, honky, how's work?&quot; &quot;Not bad, cracker, we're diversifying!&quot;　　　　安东尼：只有黑人才彼此这么叫，“黑鬼” 这个，“黑鬼”那个。你什么时候听过白人互相称呼“白鬼”吗，兄弟？“嘿，白鬼，生意怎么样？”“很好，白佬，我们正多元化发展。”　　　　Jean: I just had a gun pointed in my face...　　　　Rick: You lower your voice.　　　　Jean:... and it was my fault because I knew it was gonna happen. But if a white person sees two black men walking towards her and she turns and walks away, she's a racist, right? Well I got scared and I didn't do anything and ten seconds later I had a gun in my face. Now I am telling you, your amigo in there is going to s  ell our key to one of his homies and this time it would be really fucking great if you acted like you gave a shit!　　　　珍妮：我可是刚刚被人用枪指着我的脸　　　　里克：你给我小声点!　　　　珍妮：这还是我的错了？就因为我知道会发生什么？但是如果一个白人看见两个黑人朝她走来，她转头朝其他方向走去，她就是种族歧视者了，是吗？我当时很害怕，可是我什么都没说。十秒钟以后，就有一支枪指着我的脸。我告诉你，你那黑帮朋友会把我们的钥匙卖给他帮里的同伙的。而这次要是在家被人给搞了，就他妈的棒极了！　　　　Anthony: Look around! You couldn't find a whiter, safer or better lit part of this city. But this white woman sees two black guys, who look like UCLA students, strolling down the sidewalk and her reaction is blind fear. I mean, look at us! Are we dressed like gangbangers? Do we look threatening?　　　　Peter :No.　　　　Anthony:Fact, if anybody should be scared, it's us: the only two black faces surrounded by a sea of over-caffeinated white people, patrolled by the triggerhappy LAPD. So, why aren't we scared?　　　　Peter: Because we have guns?　　　　Anthony: You could be right.　　　　安东尼：看看你的周围！你不可能找到更多白人，更安全，或者比这个城市更好的地方了。但是这个白女人看见两个黑人，两个就像加州大学洛杉矶分校的学生从便道走来，她的反应就只有恐惧？看看我们，哥们。我们的衣着像黑帮的吗？我们看起来很有威胁吗？　　　　彼得：没有。　　　　安东尼：事实上，要是这有谁该害怕的话，那也是我们该害怕！这地方到处都是兴奋过度的白人，就我们两个黑面孔。周围还有一群动不动就开枪的洛杉矶警察在巡逻。你告诉我，我们为什么不害怕呢？　　　　彼得：因为我们有枪？　　　　安东尼：你说对了。　　　　Cameron: It's about time you realise what it's like to be black.　　　　Christine: Oh, and you're talking about being black? The closest you ever came to being black, Cameron, was watching the Cosby Show.　　　　Cameron: Well, at least I didn't watch it with the rest of the equestrian team.　　　　卡梅隆：早晚你会懂做黑人是什么感觉。　　　　克里斯汀：好像你知道似的？你最觉得自己是黑人的时候，卡梅隆，是你看The Cosby Show的时候。　　　　卡梅隆：是吗？但起码我不是和其他的高级阶层的人一起看的。　　　　引自百科
